## Steps for the Bachelor Thesis


| Steps  | Status   | Due Date | Subtasks | Next Steps |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| Wikipedia Extraction | Ongoing  | 24.07. | a) Small Sample b) Large Dataset | Prepare the small sample |
| Data Processing   | In plans | 16.08. | [TBD](https://stackabuse.com/python-for-nlp-neural-machine-translation-with-seq2seq-in-keras/) - Read this by 15.08. and understand what input will we need, also create an abstract and plan of what I am writing about | by 19.08. - understand the code for the algorithm and the algorithm itself |
| Neural Network Algorithms   | In plans | 27.08. | TBD | TBD |
| Experiment with results   | In plans  | 06.09. | TBD | TBD |
| Write the paper | In plans  | 02.10. | TBD | TBD |
| Format the paper | In plans  | 09.10. | TBD | TBD |


| Meetings with the professor  | Time | Previous Notes | Notes | Next Steps |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|
| Meeting 1: Rethinking the idea | 15.06.  | Plan | Machine Learning from Wikipedia Lingually Interlinked Titles | Work on Wikipedia Scraping |
| Meeting 2: Wikipedia Scraping | 22.07. | Wikipedia Scraping + Basic Algorithm Testing, Maybe change the agenda, I don't fully understand how to extract meaningful data from titles, also titles are rarely translatable (or their translations rarely change from english to german) | - | 
| Meeting 3: Beginning of algorithm | 16.08. | LSTM input preparation as well as first runs | - |
